In this project our goal  is to transform the raw data into information and then convert it into knowledge by performing data cleaning and analysis for testing the given Hypothesis. 
The Null Hypothesis H0 is "Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming".
The H0 means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of a month say April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not. This monthly analysis has to be done for all 12 months over the 10 year period. So you are basically resampling your data from hourly to monthly, then comparing the same month over the 10 year period.
Libraries used are pandas,matplotlib,numpy,seaborn,warning.
